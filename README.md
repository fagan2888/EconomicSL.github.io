**Economic Simulation Platform (ESP)** is a community driven, open-source project to develop a user-friendly
modeling platform and tool stack for building scalable, data-driven, and reproducible agent-based models (ABMs) of economic systems on the JVM using Scala and Akka. It is a suite of tools which allows users to build an agent-based
model of their unique economic system with minimal development using existing plug-and-play modules.
