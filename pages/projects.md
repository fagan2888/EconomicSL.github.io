There are several projects which are planning on using ESL. It is our hope that these varied use cases both: 1.) test the generalizability of our library, and 2.) result in the instantiation of a wide breadth of common economic components which future users can employ.

**Amlin Project --- ABM of the Insurance Sector**

The insurance market is subject to many effects that are conveniently and straightforwardly accessible to agent-based modeling: heterogeneity, insurance cycles, systemic risk arising from a lack of diversity, the network structure on insurance-reinsurance-retrocession networks, spatial, infrastructural, and regional aspects, as well as optimization with non-Gaussian, heavy-tailed, distributions (of both the probability and the size of events). This project, in cooperation with MS Amlin, will employ Economic Simulation Library as the framework for its agent-based models, thereby attempting to achieve a high degree generalizability, to allow for standardization and reproduction, and to make use of the important features embedded in ESL.
