J. Doyne Farmer is Director of the Complexity Economics program at the Institute for New Economic Thinking at the Oxford Martin School, Professor in the Mathematical Institute at the University of Oxford, and an External Professor at the Santa Fe Institute. His current research is in economics, including agent-based modeling, financial instability and technological progress. He was a founder of Prediction Company, a quantitative automated trading firm that was sold to the United Bank of Switzerland in 2006. His past research includes complex systems, dynamical systems theory, time series analysis and theoretical biology. During the eighties he was an Oppenheimer Fellow and the founder of the Complex Systems Group at Los Alamos National Laboratory. While a graduate student in the  70’s he build the first wearable digital computer, which was successfully used to predict the game of roulette.

Paul Rauwolf is one of the lead software architects for ESL. His research interests rest at the intersection of computer science, economics, and psychology. During his masters he studied machine learning and for his thesis focused on the development of artificial reward systems which generated exploratory behavior in robots similar to children that are placed in novel environments. He attained his PhD at the University of Bath using agent-based and mathematical models to explain biases in human decision-making and behavioral economic data. At INET he is part of the <a href="{{site.url}}/projects/"> Amlin insurance project</a>, focusing on how the use of second-best risk models affect the trade-off between profitability and the safety of diversification.

David Pugh is developing open-source, scalable, data-driven, and reproducible agent-based models (ABMs) of using Akka, Cassandra, Scala, and Spark. He is broadly interested in computational economics, particularly projection methods for solving functional equations, and "Big Data" econometrics using Julia, Python, and R. He is keen on learning new methodologies for enhancing reproducibility of computational scientific research.

Davoud Taghawi-Nejad holds a PhD in Economics of Complexity and Innovation. He published on business cycles, network effects of central bank policy, the use of artificial intelligence and computational methods in economics. At MIT and the University of Sao Paulo Davoud applied this research to create policy simulators. Amongst others he created simulations of the Saudi Arabian Labor market and the Brazilian education system in order to improve policy making in this fields. This research was conducted using a modelling platform he developed called Agent-Based Computational Economy Platform (ABCE).

Alissa Kleinnijenhuis is currently doing her Dphil under the supervision of Professor Doyne Farmer. She is affiliated with the Mathematical and Computational Finance Group, which is a research group in the Mathematics Department. Her research focuses on systemic risk. She is mainly interested in developing realistic mathematical models of financial contagion. Her current work focuses on: financial contagion via multiple channels (such as via overlapping portfolio’s and via several different kinds of exposures), and stress testing.

Adri&aacute;n obtained a degree in Physics from the Universidade de Santiago de Compostela and a master's degree on Theoretical Physics of Complex Systems from the Université Pierre et Marie Curie (Paris VI). He developed his master's thesis at the École Normale Supérieure (Paris), where he used concepts from statistical mechanics and autocatalytic processes to design a spatial economics model with which to study the role of transportation costs and spatial inhomogeneities in a context of sustainable development. He completed his PhD at the Institute for Cross-Disciplinary Physics and Complex Systems (IFISC, Palma de Mallorca). During that time he worked on agent-based models of collective dynamics in socio-economic systems, investigating the mechanisms behind processes such as the formation of opinions in social groups, the competition of languages in bilingual communities, and herding behaviour in financial markets. He is interested in the development of agent-based modelling techniques and the use of analytical tools from statistical physics for the purpose of understanding the economy as a complex system, with a focus on policy assessment. He is currently involved in the MISTRAL project (Multi-scale infrastructure systems analytics), where he uses spatially-distributed agent-based models to study the economic impact of infrastructure investments.
