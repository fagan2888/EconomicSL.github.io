J. Doyne Farmer is Director of the Complexity Economics program at the Institute for New Economic Thinking at the Oxford Martin School, Professor in the Mathematical Institute at the University of Oxford, and an External Professor at the Santa Fe Institute. His current research is in economics, including agent-based modeling, financial instability and technological progress. He was a founder of Prediction Company, a quantitative automated trading firm that was sold to the United Bank of Switzerland in 2006. His past research includes complex systems, dynamical systems theory, time series analysis and theoretical biology. During the eighties he was an Oppenheimer Fellow and the founder of the Complex Systems Group at Los Alamos National Laboratory. While a graduate student in the  70â€™s he build the first wearable digital computer, which was successfully used to predict the game of roulette.

Davoud Taghawi-Nejad holds a PhD in Economics of Complexity and Innovation. He published on business cycles, network effects of central bank policy, the use of artificial intelligence and computational methods in economics. At MIT and the University of Sao Paulo Davoud applied this research to create policy simulators. Amongst others he created simulations of the Saudi Arabian Labor market and the Brazilian education system in order to improve policy making in this fields. This research was conducted using a modelling platform he developed called Agent-Based Computational Economy Platform (ABCE).
